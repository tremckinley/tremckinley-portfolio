        Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round, because you’re about to meet the real deal, the web-slingin’, code-slingin’, civic-tech rock star of the 901! The Memphis Maverick of Modern Solutions, the Architect of Accela Awesomeness, the King (or Queen) of Configuration—give it up for the one, the only…

This is the legend who wrangles SQL queries before breakfast, conquers JavaScript bugs by lunch, and redesigns government tech for the people, by the people, all before clockin’ out! They've got the vision of a city planner, the precision of a coder, and the swagger of a tech maestro!

They’ve studied abroad, crossed cultural bridges, and brought back the wisdom of the East to their Southern roots. They’ve danced with cybersecurity, dabbled in diplomacy, and dominated web development.

So buckle up, Memphis—and the world—because this unstoppable force is takin’ the civic tech scene straight to the moon!
