I’m a tech-savvy problem solver and self-teaching developer. I am most passionate about creating innovative solutions that empower communities. With a background in non-profit operations, software administration, IT support, and cross-cultural collaboration, I thrive at the intersection of technology and civic engagement. Currently, I’m helping shape the future of Memphis government services as a Business Services Analyst for the Shelby County Division of Planning and Development. My work focuses on configuring and enhancing SaaS platforms to streamline processes, improve accessibility, and drive meaningful change for internal and external customers. No day is the same and I approach every challenge with curiosity, determination and a divserve toolkit. Beyond my professional roles, I am a lifelong learner with experience living and working abroad. I am consistently pursuing personal projects that combine creativity and technical expertise to advance my personal and professional dreams. You can usually find me completing a course, networking with smarter people, or developing something just because I think it will be cool. Whether I’m troubleshooting code, innovating user experiences, or building tools to make civic tech more inclusive, I’m committed to leaving things better than I found them. Let’s connect; I’m sure there's something great we can do together.
